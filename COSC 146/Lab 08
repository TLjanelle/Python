# Requires: Python version 3
#
# Description: write a function which returns the timestamp. open an input
# log file that contains timestamp messages,  read each line of the
# input file into your script, apply your function to each of those line, and then print just the timestamp using the
# return value of your user-defined fuction.

# Note: requires input file "lab08_log_sshd_messages" 
# be in the same directory as this Py script.

# Define a function called get_timestamp() which takes one input argument/parameter and returns the timestamp. 
# Each log message has a timestamp which has NO whitepace characters in the timestamp itself (so, the
# first whitespace character in the string which you are processing will be just after the timestamp). Your
# get_timestamp() function must use the split() function (and thus return index 0 of the split)
# which is described in the book PY4E 8.9 (Lists and strings). In the function definition, you must name
# the input variable msg.
def get_timestamp(msg):
    return msg.split(" ")[0]

# store name of input file in a variable.
file_input = "lab08_log_sshd_messages"

# open file handle to file.
fhin = open( file_input , "r" ) 

# read one line of file from file handle and enter loop. 
# Stops when EOF reached and prints to the screen the timestamp.
for line in fhin:
    print(get_timestamp(line))

# close file handle.
fhin.close()
