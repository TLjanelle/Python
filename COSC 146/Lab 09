# Requires: Python version 3
#
# Description: Create python lists utilizing multiple functions including insert, copy, sort, append, and while loops.

# Define a function called lines() which takes no arguments and contains just one print statement:
# print(“==============================”)
def lines():
    print("==============================")

# Create 2 empty python lists - one called K and one called L.
K = []
L = []

# Insert into list K at index 2 the integer 42.
K.insert(2,42)

# Insert into list K at index 0 the integer 84.
K.insert(0, 84)

# Insert into list K at index 1 the integer 21.
K.insert(1,21)

# Insert into list L at index 2 the string ‘Hello’.
L.insert(2,'Hello')

# Insert into list L at index 0 the string ‘world’.
L.insert(0,'world')

# Insert into list L at index 1 the string ‘!’.
L.insert(1,'!')

# Create a new list, called M, which contains a copy of the contents of K. You must use Python
# functionality to copy the contents of K into M - either all together in one statement or via multiple
# statements which copy the index values in M to K.
M = K.copy()

# Create a new list, called N, which contains a copy of the contents of L. You must use Python
# functionality to copy the contents of L into N - either all together in one statement or via multiple
# statements which copy the index values in N to L.
N = L.copy()

# Reverse M via the reverse function.
M.reverse()

# Reverse N via the reverse function.
N.reverse()

# call the lines() function.
lines()

# In 4 separate print() statements, print the contents of K, L, M, N.
print(K)
print(L)
print(M)
print(N)

# call the lines() function.
lines()

# Sort K via the sort function.
K.sort()

# Sort L via the sort function.
L.sort()

# Sort M via the sort function.
M.sort()

# Sort N via the sort function.
N.sort()

# In 4 separate print() statements, print the contents of K, L, M, N.
print(K)
print(L)
print(M)
print(N)

# call the lines() function.
lines()

# Create an empty list X.
X = []

# Using the append function, append K to the list X.
X.append(K)

# Using the append function, append L to the list X.
X.append(L)

# Using the append function, append M to the list X.
X.append(M)

# Using the append function, append N to the list X.
X.append(N)

# Create a counter variable i and initialize it to 0.
# Create a while loop with a boolean condition that i is less than length of X.
# As the first line of the while loop, print X at index i.
# As the second line of the while loop, increment the index i by 1.
i = 0
while i < len(X):
    print(X[i])
    i += 1

# call the lines() function.
lines()

# Clear the contents of the list X via the clear function.
X.clear()

# Set X equal to the contents of the four lists - K, L, M, N. Use the join operator (+) to concatenate 
# in the statement. 
X = K + L + M + N

# Reinitialize the variable i to 0.
# Create a while loop with a boolean condition that i is less than length of X.
# As the first line of the while loop, print X at index i.
# As the second line of the while loop, increment the index i by 1.
i = 0
while i < len(X):
    print(X[i])
    i += 1

# call the lines() function.
lines()
