# Description: Write a script that prompts the user to enter a string, stores that input in a variable, and the outputs one
# of two responses to the userâ€™s input.

# The script must first instantiate and initialize exactly 4 variables. 

prompt = "Enter a string: "
response = input(prompt)
hitchhiker = 'Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything'
deadhead1 = 'Your typical city involved in a typical daydream.'
deadhead2 = 'Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings.'


# Use an if statement to determine if the user input the number 42

if (response == "42"):
    print(hitchhiker)
else:
    print(deadhead1 + "\n" + deadhead2)
