# Requires: Python version 3
#
# Description: Write a script that prompts the user to enter two numbers at the keyboard and then sums the numbers
# and displays the sum to the screen. Two functions must be defined. 


# The first function takes no arguments, the  body must prompt the user for a number and store the number.
def get_sum():
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    return num

# The second function must take 2 arguments to sum, and the body of the function 
# must return the sum of the two numbers that were passed as arguments to the function. 
def sum_2_sums(n1, n2):
    added = n1 + n2
    return added

# Define 2 variables and set each to call the get_sum function and store the numbers.
num1 = get_sum()
num2 = get_sum()

# Define a variable and set it to call the sum_2_sums function using the variables defined to get user input
sum = sum_2_sums(num1, num2)

# Print the sum
print(f'Sum = {sum}')
