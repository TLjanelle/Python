# Requires: Python version 3
#
# Description: This program prompts the user to enter a number representing a percentage grade, and the
# program will print out out the user's equivalent letter grade.

# Prompt the user to enter their numerical grade, and store the grade as a float.
grade = float(input("Enter grade (e.g., for 90.2%, enter 90.2 and not .902): "))
 
# Use a conditonal to determine the students grade and print the result.

## If a student enters a grade greater than 100 , their grade is an A with extra credit
if (grade > 100):
    print ("Your grade is A with extra credit.")

## If a students enters a grade greater than or equal to 90 and less than or equal to 100, their grade is an A
elif (grade >= 90.0):
    print("Your grade is A.")

## If a students enters a grade greater than or equal to 80 and less than 90, their grade is a B
elif (grade >= 80.0):
    print("Your grade is B.")

    ## If a students enters a grade greater than or equal to 70 and less than 80, their grade is a C
elif (grade >= 70.0):
    print("Your grade is C.")

## If a students enters a grade greater than or equal to 60 and less than 70, their grade is a D
elif (grade >= 60.0):
    print ("Your grade is D.")
## If a students enters a grade greater than or equal to 0 and less than 60, their grade is an E
elif (grade >= 0.0):
    print("Your grade is E.")
## If the value entered is a negative number, then the output is Invalid.
else:
    print("Invalid Number.")
