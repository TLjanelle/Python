# Requires: Python version 3
#
# Description: Write a script that prompts the user to enter two numbers at the keyboard and then sums the numbers
# and displays the sum to the screen. Two functions must be defined. Then use a loop to ask if the user wants to
# sum two numbers again using yes or no.

# The first function takes no arguments, the  body must prompt the user for a number and store the number.
def get_sum():
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    return num

# The second function must take 2 arguments to sum, and the body of the function
# must return the sum of the two numbers that were passed as arguments to the function.
def sum_2_sums(n1, n2):
    added = n1 + n2
    return added

# Use a while loop to ask the user if they want to continue and force the 
# first run by initializing a string in the variable continue_
# Note: continue without the underscore is a default statement in python.
continue_ = 'n'

while (continue_ == 'n' or continue_ == 'N' or continue_ == 'no' or continue_ == 'NO'):
    
    # Define 2 variables and set each to call the get_sum function and store the numbers.
    num1 = get_sum()
    num2 = get_sum()

    # Define a variable and set it to call the sum_2_sums function using the variables defined to get user input
    sum = sum_2_sums(num1, num2)

    # Print the sum
    print(f'Sum = {sum} ')

    # Ask the user if they would like to continue
    prompt = 'Quit (Y/N)? '
    continue_ = input(prompt)   

    # Use an if statement to determine the users input. YES or an invalid input 
    # should exit the program, NO should rerun the program.
    if (continue_ == 'y' or continue_ == 'Y' or continue_ == 'yes' or continue_ == 'YES'):
        exit()
    elif (continue_ == 'n' or continue_ == 'N' or continue_ == 'no' or continue_ == 'NO'):
        pass 
    else:
        print('Invalid input.')
        exit()
