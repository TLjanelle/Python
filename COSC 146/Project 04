# Requires: Python version 3

# Description : Write the information (timestamps) to a file. 
# You must have a function which takes an input log message line and 
# returns the timestamp found at the beginning of it. 
# Do you not print to the screen, write to a file called timestamps.txt.

# Note: requires input file "project04_log_sshd_messages" 
# be in the same directory as this Py script.

# Note: Writes to output file in same directory 
# called "timestamps".

# Warning: each run of this program overwrites 
# contents of "project04_log_sshd_messages"

# Function to read line and parse on the whitespace character
# then returns the timestamp only
def get_timestamp(msg):
    timestamp = msg.split(" ")[0]
    return timestamp

# store in a variable the name of input file.
file_input  = "project04_log_sshd_messages.txt"

# store in a variable the name of output file.
file_output = "timestamps.txt"

# open file handle for reading ("r") to input file 
fhin  = open( file_input  , "r" ) 

# open file handle for writing ("w") to output file 
fhout = open( file_output , "w" )

# read one line of file from file handle
# and enter loop. Stops when EOF reached.
for line in fhin:
    # store in a variable the timestamp
    line = get_timestamp(line)
    # print to file handle
    fhout.write(line + "\n")

# close reading file handle.
fhin.close()
# close writing file handle.
fhout.close()
